# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study guide serves both as a space for my notes on the various prework topics and as a means of practicing said skills. Over the course of building the wepbage, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned the core functionality of Github and now know the general process for working on a project.
